# Experiment 2
# Aim: Study of List in Python
## Theory:
In this experiment we learned how to use and edit lists in python. We added elements to list, removed elements from list, sorted elements of list,etc.
list.append() is used to add elements into the list, list.remove() is used to remove elements from list, max() is used to find maximum , min() used to find minimum, len() is used to find length of list.
list1.extend(list2) is used to merge two lists.
list[2] is used to find third element of the list.
## Algorithm: 
    a)Algorithm: Analyzing Student Marks
    1)Initialize Data: Create a list containing the numerical marks of the students.
    2)Find Extremes:
        Identify the highest value in the list (max()).
        Identify the lowest value in the list (min()).
    3)Count Entries: Determine how many items (students) are in the list(len()).
    4)Calculate Totals: * Add all the marks together to get the Sum(sum()).
    5)Calculate the Mean: Divide the Sum by the Total Number of Students to find the Average(sum()/len()).
    6)Organize Data: Sort the list of marks from the lowest value to the highest value (Ascending Order)(list.sort()).
    7)Display Results: Print all the calculated values and the sorted list to the screen.

    b)Modifying a Grocery List
    1)Create the List: Start with an initial list of five items: carrot, potato, spinach, eggplant, and cheese.
    2)Add an Item: Update the list by adding "milk" to the very end using ".append("milk")" command.
    3)Remove an Item: Search for "potato" in the list and delete it using ".remove("potato")" command.
    4)Remove another Item: Search for "carrot" in the list and delete it using ".remove("carrot")" command.
    5)Output Results: Display the final, updated version of the list.

## conclusion: Hence lists were implemented in python and operations were done on the lists.
